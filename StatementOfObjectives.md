# Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
# HITECH Program
# Statement of Objectives for eAPD application
## 1.0 Background and Purpose
### 1.1	Background
The Promoting Interoperability Program (PIP), previously known as the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program, is part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which is part of the broader American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The PIP was designed as an economic stimulus program which would push the advancement of the Health Information Technology (HIT) by incentivizing the adoption and meaningful use of Certified Electronic Health Record technologies (CEHRT) for Medicaid Eligible Providers. The program is supported by combined Federal/State funding, managed by the State’s Medicaid Agency (SMA), overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and governed by regulations found in 42 CFR 495, Part D.

Under this regulation, States are required to submit three categories of documents to build their programs: The State Medicaid Health Information Technology Plan (SMHP), the Advanced Planning Document (APD), and procurements. The APD provides states a structured framework to describe any proposed projects in support of the PIP; however, because it is primarily a paper document, the content of the APD can vary. Upon review and approval of an APD, state projects may be supported using enhanced Federal match (i.e. the Federal government will reimburse states 90 cents for every dollar they spend).

In an effort to modernize the HITECH APD creation, submission, review, and decision process, CMS partnered with [18F/GSA](https://18f.gsa.gov/) to leverage modern software development techniques coupled with user-centered design to develop a system to streamline the APD experience as part of the Medicaid and CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) program Portal [MACPro](https://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/medicaid-and-chip-program-portal/medicaid-and-chip-program-portal.html) suite of products. In its first iteration, the eAPD focused on developing a robust APD builder which presented states a more guided authoring process and providing automatic calculations for proposed budgets. The user testing and subsequent pilot was met with enthusiastic support from CMS leadership and State users.

Because of this encouraging progress, CMS expanded the scope of the project to include all other components of the Medicaid IT Enterprise. The system roadmap has been updated to include support for Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and Eligibility & Enrollment (E&E) APDs. There is still much work to be done for the vision of the eAPD to be realized.

### 1.2	Problem

The eAPD application tackles several different problems faced by  CMS and states. Each of the following pain points describes a component of the creation, submission, review, and decision process which is currently rooted in inconsistently applied manual systems or subjective narrative.  

**Consistency of submissions**

While templates and guidance exist for many of the HITECH related documents, the consistency and quality of submissions are dependent on the author to properly interpret the guidance and author a document with the appropriate/required information. Documents often include extraneous information unrelated to the request and can often prevent the reviewer from understanding a state’s request. As states update their submissions from year to year, there can be a dramatic variation in each submission. Some states produce wholly new submissions, some states produce a track-changes versions, and some states only include the updated information.

**Process Transparency and Lack of Automation**

Tracking of the request, the review, response, and decision of a submission is largely a manual process that requires duplicate data entry in various systems. Completing the process requires a familiarity of the existing Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with a high likelihood of missing a step. Once a submission has been received by CMS, states are often left guessing as to the status of their submission and must request a status update from the Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) state officer. Internally, providing the status of submissions also requires manual status updates and verification. 
There is no singular approach to tracking submissions that are received or responded to by CMS. As noted above, each step of the process is manual and spans multiple programs and systems. 

**Communication between states and CMS**

As part of the review cycle, after a state has submitted their submissions to CMS, there may be a need for additional information. This request is conducted in an inconsistent manner utilizing email, Word documents, or direct markup in the submission to itemize or reference content within the submission. Similarly, the response from the state is conducted in an inconsistent fashion. In both cases, inefficiencies result in a cycle of back and forth that does not always provide sufficient detail for the CMS reviewer to support their decision.

**Document and submission management**

Submissions are primarily submitted to CMS via email. As each submission is received, there are multiple steps that require the logging, tracking, and storing of documents in multiple locations which creates multiple copies of the document through the organization. Once a decision has been made, letters are emailed out and also stored in an inconsistent manner within SharePoint’s document library. Accessing and tracking documents created by states or by CMS is a manual and labor-intensive effort.

**Auditing**

CMS is often subject to audit from an internal and external stakeholders. This requires staff to provide documentation that shows how CMS followed the existing SOPs and provide primary source documentation. Because of the nature of our processes and our document management, this process is a labor-intensive process to compile and provide to various requestors.


**Analytics**

All the information that is contained within the IAPD (implementation advance planning document), SMHP and Procurement documents is held in free-form text, making data analytics a primarily manual process. Information regarding approved funding, project scope/status/milestones, expended funding, contractors used, types of procurements, etc. require manual input from a non-primary user. Through use of the Excel-based tracker, we are able to perform rudimentary analytics concerning the review cycle, however when we need to provide information about data contained within a submission, the free text necessitates a manual lookup into each submission.

**Socializing information**

Sharing information between stakeholders is managed through email/FTP/disparate systems, and heavily relies on CMS analysts and States to share key information or best practices. This creates knowledge gaps and knowledge silos, and does not promote consistency across various state approaches.

## 2.0 Scope

**Description of Work to be Performed**
CMS seeks agile software development services. The services to be provided will include all aspects of the software development process, including initial planning, design, software development and coding, prototyping, documentation, testing, and configuration.

CMS intends that the software delivered under this task order will be committed to the public domain. The Contractor will have to obtain CMS permission before delivering software under this task order that incorporates any software that is not free and open source. The Contractor must post all developed code to a GitHub repository designated by CMS. The Contractor will not be responsible for importing any pending case data, practitioner data, or other data into the new System.

This software development project will use agile development principles, with robust documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible infrastructure. CMS expects that the development process will be collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent communication between CMS and the Contractor. CMS expects that the development process will consist of 2-week sprint cycles, and that the initial phases of the development process will focus on refining the existing APD builder, building the APD update experience,and creating a workflow for the submission and routing of the electronic documents.
CMS has designated an employee who will be empowered to serve as the Product Owner for this project. CMS Product Owner will set direction, make prioritization choices to build a product roadmap, consider and address the business needs of CMS, and support the other members of the development team. The Contractor will assist CMS with product management and facilitation.
CMS, not the Contractor, will be responsible for the hosting of the deployed System and obtaining any necessary Authority to Operate (ATO). CMS will also determine what security controls are required and whether they have been satisfied. CMS expects to provide those security controls to the Contractor as either acceptance criteria or separate user stories. The Contractor is expected to use best practices for security in delivering code.

CMS intends to deploy the new System as soon as the software for the new System has been sufficiently developed to provide the minimal viable functionality required to support an acceptable level of CMS’s fundamental APD operations. The minimal viable functionality, which was completed in July 2019, includes the ability for external users to author an APD in a structured form and export the APD as a PDF for submission to CMS. Enhancements to the application will incorporate functionality such as updating previous APDs as a new submission, submitting additional types of documents for review, tracking and monitoring submissions, and reporting. CMS expects that substantial further development of the software and modifications to the System will occur following a human-centered design methodology and the sequencing of additional functions will be determined as we continue to solve for user and stakeholder needs.

### 2.1 Product Vision

As a core function of the MACPro suite, the eAPD system will serve as a singular, streamlined portal for state, federal, and associated partners to develop, review, track, analyze, and share APD, contract submissions, and data to improve accountability and outcomes associated with the State’s Medicaid business needs. The system will be developed and maintained through continuous integration/continuous delivery methods with a loosely coupled architecture connected by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

### 2.2 Anticipated Period of Performance, Budget, and Ceiling Price

The not to exceed ceiling on this contract will be $2 million for the base year and an additional $2 million for an option period of one year, if exercised.

## 4.0 Operating Constraints (Non-functional Requirements)

### 4.1 Environment

The System will be deployed to Amazon Web Service (AWS) infrastructure provided by CMS. Deployments are automated via CircleCI continuous integration/continuous deployment. Contractor is required to maintain deployment scripts and configurations as changes are required. CMS will provide the necessary AWS configuration information to the Contractor.

The system is composed of three primary parts: a PostgreSQL database, a backend API application, and a frontend web application. All of the custom software is in Javascript. Data files are written in either JSON or YAML, depending on who is expected to edit them (e.g., data files that CMS may edit directly are written in YAML). Deployment scripts are written in Bash script.

The backend API application uses these primary software libraries and frameworks:
* Node.js 10.14, or higher 10.x version
* Express web application server

### 4.3 Special Clauses
*Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables* – CMS intends that all software and documentation delivered by the Contractor will be owned by CMS and committed to the public domain. This software and documentation includes, but is not limited to, data, documents, graphics, code, plans, reports, schedules, schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the like; all new open source software created by the Contractor and forks or branches of current open source software where the Contractor has made a modification; and all new tooling, scripting configuration management, infrastructure as code, or any other final changes or edits to successfully deploy or operate the software.

To the extent that the Contractor seeks to incorporate any software that was not first produced in the performance of this task order in the software delivered under this task order, CMS encourages the Contractor to incorporate either software that is in the public domain, or free and open source software that qualifies under the Open Source Definition promulgated by the Open Source Initiative. In any event, the Contractor must promptly disclose to CMS in writing, and list in the documentation, any software incorporated in the delivered software that is subject to a license.

If software delivered by the Contractor incorporates software that is subject to an open source license that provides implementation guidance, then the Contractor must ensure compliance with that guidance. If software delivered by the Contractor incorporates software that is subject to an open source license that does not provide implementation guidance, then the Contractor must attach or include the terms of the license within the work itself, such as in code comments at the beginning of a file, or in a license file within a software repository.

In addition, the Contractor must obtain written permission from CMS before incorporating into the delivered software any software that is subject to a license that does not qualify under the Open Source Definition promulgated by the Open Source Initiative. If CMS grants such written permission, then the Contractor’s rights to use that software must be promptly assigned to CMS.
