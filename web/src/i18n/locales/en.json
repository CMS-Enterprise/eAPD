The commitment to formal system development methodology and open, reusable system architecture is extremely important in order to ensure that states can more easily change and maintain systems, as well as integrate and interoperate with a clinical and administrative ecosystem designed to deliver person-centric services and benefits. Modularity is breaking down systems requirements into component parts. Extremely complex systems can be developed as part of a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Modularity also helps address the challenges of customization. Baseline web services and capabilities can be developed for and used by anyone, with exceptions for specific business processes handled by a separate module that interoperates with the baseline modules. With modularity, changes can be made independently to the baseline capabilities without affecting how the extension works. By doing so, the design ensures that future iterations of software can be deployed without breaking custom functionality. A critical element of compliance with this condition is providing CMS with an understanding of where services and code will be tightly coupled, and where the state will pursue a more aggressive decoupling strategy.CMS description text goes here.",

Mitigation plans for major Medicaid E&E system or MMIS projects should address minimum expected functionality, critical success factors, and risk factors as tied to major milestones identified in the APD. The mitigation plans should also reflect key events and dates that would trigger the mitigation, and projected timeframe for the mitigation sunset. States should consider strategies to address risks for the M&O phase of the project, such as staffing issues and software upgrades.
