  The CMS HITECH APD app is the new way to create and manage your state’s HITECH
  Advanced Planning Documents (APDs). Follow the steps to fill in the required information,
  and the app will generate a completed APD you can submit to a CMS State Officer
  for review.


  All your state’s APDs are listed here. Save your work in progress
  and come back to a draft at any time. When you’re ready to submit an APD, download a
  PDF and email it to CMS at MedicaidHITECH@cms.hhs.gov just like you’ve done before.
none: You have not created any APDs.
