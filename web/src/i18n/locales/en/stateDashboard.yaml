    The eAPD app is the new way to create and manage your state’s Advanced Planning Documents (APDs). Follow the steps to fill in the required information, and the app will generate a completed APD you can submit to a CMS State Officer for review.

    
    All your state’s APDs are listed here. Save your work in progress and come back to a draft at any time. When you’re ready to submit an APD, download a PDF and email it to CMS, just like you’ve done before.
