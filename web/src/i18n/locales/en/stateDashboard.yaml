    The eAPD is designed to help you create and manage your HITECH Advanced Planning Documents (APDs). Create a new APD or select one already in progress to edit. The eAPD will capture required information needed to generate a completed APD that you can submit to CMS for review. When you are ready to review and submit your APD, use the export function to export the APD as a PDF, and email it to CMS at <a href="mailto:MedicaidHITECH@cms.hhs.gov">MedicaidHITECH@cms.hhs.gov</a> just like you've done before.
