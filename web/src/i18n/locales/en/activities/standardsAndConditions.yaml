    and conditions.
modularity:
  instruction:
    heading: Modularity
    helpText: >-
      Modularity requires the use of a modular, flexible approach
      to systems development, including the use of open interfaces
      and exposed application programming interfaces (API); the
      separation of business rules from core programming; and the
      availability of business rules in both human and machine-readable
      formats.


      Commitment to formal system development methodology
      and open reusable system architecture is extremely important in
      order to ensure that states can more easily change and maintain
      systems. Integration and interoperability with a clinical and
      administrative ecosystem, is designed to deliver person-centric services
      and benefits. Modularity is breaking down systems requirements into
      component parts. Extremely complex systems can be developed as
      part of a service-oriented architecture (SOA).


      Modularity also helps address the challenges of customization.
      Baseline web services and capabilities can be developed for and used
      by anyone, with exceptions for specific business processes handled
      by a separate module that interoperates with the baseline modules.


      Changes can be made independently to baseline
      capabilities without affecting how the extension works. By doing
      so, the design ensures that future iterations of software can be
      deployed without breaking custom functionality. A critical element
      of compliance with this condition is providing CMS with an
      understanding where services and code will be integrated, and where
      the state will pursue a more aggressive decoupling strategy.

mita:
  instruction:
    heading: Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA)
    helpText: >-
      This condition requires states to advance and align increasingly
      in MITA maturity for business, architecture, and data. CMS expects
      states to complete and make measurable progress in implementing their
      MITA roadmaps. CMS strives to accelerate the modernization of Medicaid
      enterprise that been achieved.

industryStandards:
  instruction:
    heading: Industry Standards
    helpText: >-
      States must ensure alignment with, and incorporation of, industry
      standards: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
      Act of 1996 (HIPAA) security, privacy and transaction standards;
      accessibility standards established under section 508 of the
      Rehabilitation Act, or standards that provide greater accessibility
      for individuals with disabilities, and compliance with federal
      civil rights laws; standards adopted by the Secretary under section
      1104 of the Affordable Care Act; and standards and protocols
      adopted by the Secretary under section 1561 of the Affordable
      Care Act.


      CMS must ensure that Medicaid infrastructure and
      information system investments are made with the assurance that
      timely and reliable adoption of industry standards and productive
      use of those standards are part of the investments. Industry
      standards promote reuse, data exchange, and reduction of
      administrative burden on patients, providers, and applicants.

      Describe how this activity will support the Industry Standards condition.
leverage:
  instruction:
    heading: Leverage
    helpText: >-
      State solutions should promote sharing among, leverage, and reuse of
      Medicaid technologies and systems among states. States
      can benefit substantially from the experience and investments
      of other states through the reuse of components and technologies
      already developed, consistent with a service-oriented architecture,
      from publicly available or commercially sold components and
      products, and from the use of cloud technologies to share
      infrastructure and applications.


      CMS commits to work assertively with the states to identify promising
      state systems  that can be leveraged by other states. CMS strongly
      encourages states to move to regional or multi-state solutions
      when cost effective. In addition, CMS will expedite APD approvals for states
      that are participating in shared development activities (including
      developing components intended for successful reuse) with other states.
      CMS will also review carefully any proposed investments in sub-state systems
      when the federal government is asked to share costs of updating or
      maintaining multiple systems performing redundant functions within the same state.

businessResults:
  instruction:
    heading: Business Results
    helpText: >-
      Systems should support accurate and timely processing of claims
      (including claims of eligibility), adjudications, and effective
      communications with providers, beneficiaries, and the public.
      An effective system supports and enables an effective business process,
      producing and communicating intended operational results with
      reliability and accuracy. Federal funding are not provided for systems
      unable to support desired business outcomes.
    detail: >-
      Describe how this activity will support the Business Results condition.
reporting:
  instruction:
    heading: Reporting
    helpText: >-
      Systems should be able to produce and to expose
      electronically the accurate data that are necessary for oversight,
      administration, evaluation, integrity, and transparency. These
      systems should produce reports that contribute to continuous
      improvement in business operations, transparency, and accountability.


      Reports should be automatically generated through open interfaces
      to designated federal repositories or data hubs, with appropriate
      audit trails. MITA 3.0 will provide additional detail about
      reporting requirements arising from the Affordable
      Care Act. Additional details about data definitions, specifications,
      timing, and routing of information will be supplied at a later date.
    detail: >-
      Describe how this activity will support the Reporting condition.
interoperability:
  instruction:
    heading: Interoperability
    helpText: >-
      Systems must ensure seamless coordination and integration with the
      state or federal exchanges, and
      allow interoperability with HIE, public
      health agencies, human services programs, and community
      organizations providing outreach and enrollment assistance
      services. CMS expects a key outcome government
      technology investments will be improved interaction
      and interoperability to maximize value and minimize costs
      on providers, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders.
      CMS expects Medicaid agencies to work in concert with
      exchanges (whether state or federally administered) to share
      business services and technology investments to produce
      seamless and efficient customer experiences.


      Systems must include appropriate architecture, and standardized
      communication protocols to preserve the
      ability to appropriately exchange
      data with other participants in the health and human services
      enterprise. According to MITA Framework 2.0, each state is
      “responsible for knowing and understanding its environment
      (data, applications and infrastructure) in order to map its data
      to information sharing requirements."


      The data-sharing architecture addresses conceptual and
      logical mechanisms used (i.e., data hubs, repositories, and registries).
      It also addresses data semantics, data harmonization strategies,
      shared-data ownership, security and privacy implications and
      quality of shared data.

      Describe how this activity will support the Interoperability condition.
mitigationStrategy:
  instruction:
    heading: Mitigation Strategy
    helpText: >-
      Condition § 433.112(b)(18) requires states
      submit mitigation plans addressing strategies to reduce the
      consequences of failure for all major milestones and functionality.
      Maintaining a mitigation plan is an industry standard best practice
      for any major IT build; CMS expects that states will identify
      potential risks and develop strategies to address those risks
      throughout the system lifecycle.


      Mitigation plans for major
      Medicaid E&E system or MMIS projects should address minimum
      expected functionality, critical success factors, and risk factors
      tied to major milestones identified in the APD.
      Mitigation plans should also reflect key events and dates that would trigger
      mitigation, and projected timeframe for sunset.
      States should consider strategies to address risks for the M&O project
      phase, such as staffing issues and software upgrades. CMS expects states
      to revise and resubmit their plans to CMS as risks and mitigations
      change along the system lifecycle. States’ proposed mitigations should
      be commensurate with nature and scope of identified risks.

      CMS also expects states will submit mitigation plans with the APDs to
      demonstrate compliance with this condition.

      Describe how this activity will support the Mitigation Strategy condition.
keyPersonnel:
  instruction:
    heading: Key Personnel
    helpText: >-
      The condition described at § 433.112(b)(19) requires that states
      identify their key state personnel assigned to each major project
      by name, role, and time commitment. Before we approve a state to
      launch a major IT initiative, CMS wants to ensure that the state
      team is adequately resourced. States do not need to provide key
      vendor personnel for this requirement. As stated in the
      provision, this information must be included in the APD.
      For changes to key personnel that occur after an APD is approved,
      states should notify their CMS points of contact in writing
      (including by email) and formally reflect the change in the next
      planned APD update.


      This condition refines and strengthens the existing APD
      requirements regarding personnel resource statements as required
      under 45 CFR 95.610. For Medicaid E&E APDs, states should include
      this information in the “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment (EE)
      Implementation Advance Planning Document (IAPD) Template” (OMB
      Approval Number: 0938-1268). Although there is currently no APD
      template for MMIS APDs, states must include this information in
      all MMIS APDs for major IT initiatives.

      Describe how this activity will support the Key Personnel condition.
documentation:
  instruction:
    heading: Documentation
    helpText: >-
      The condition described at § 433.112(b)(20) requires that states
      maintain documentation for certain software such that the software
      could be operated by contractors and other users. This condition is
      limited to software that is developed using federal funds; it does
      not apply to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software,
      software-as-a-service, or business-solutions-as-a-service.
      Adequate documentation means other users could operate software
      with reasonable alterations for specific hardware or operating
      system. CMS is neutral with regrard to hardware or operating
      system. Documentation must follow industry
      standards and include components,
      procedures, layouts, interfaces, inputs, outputs, and other
      necessary information to ensure systems could be installed and
      operated by a variety of contractors or other users.


      While the APD should address how the state plans to maintain documentation,
      documentation is not required with the APD.
      States are responsible for making documentation
      available upon request and to upload documentation to CALT or
      successor systems as needed for gate reviews or reuse.
      Submission to other repositories may be required as CMS explores
      other options.

minimizeCost:
  instruction:
    heading: >-
      Strategies to Minimize Cost and Difficulty on Alternative
      Hardware or Operating System
    helpText: >-
      The condition described at § 433.112(b)(21) requires that states
      consider strategies to minimize the costs and difficulty of
      operating the software on alternate hardware or operating
      systems. This condition recognizes the significant federal and
      state investments that are involved with major Medicaid IT projects
      and requires that states consider options beyond software that
      will reduce costs or promote reuse.


      States should describe strategies considered when
      deciding which most efficient solution. States are not required to
      adopt a particular strategy, but CMS must have sufficient
      description to evaluate extent the state conisdered
      other solutions. States should consider, at a minimum, the options
      that offer more opportunities for reuse, lower development costs,
      lower long-term operating costs, and shorter development time as
      well as the extent to which the solutions can be readily implemented
      with alternate hardware and operating systems.

      
      States should consider this new condition in conjunction with existing APD
      requirements regarding cost benefit analyses required at 45 CFR
      95.605 or § 95.610.
    detail: >-
      Describe how this activity will support the Cost Minimization condition.
