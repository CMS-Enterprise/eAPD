      heading: Other Funding Description
      detail: >-
        Provide a high level description of funds that are not directly tied to
        the HITECH Medicaid grant. This funding may come from another federal
        source, another state agency, and/or donations or contributions from a
        third party such as payer and provider subscription fees. If other funds
        will be used to cover the State share tied to the HITECH Medicaid grant,
        please include a justification for this here. (Review SMD Letter 10‐016
        for examples of grants for inclusion.)

    instruction:
      heading: Other Funding Amount
      detail: >-
        Provide the total amount of funds not associated with the HITECH
        Medicaid grant (i.e. any cost allocated funding from all parties) and
        the amount from other funding that will not be used for the State share
        of the HITECH Medicaid grant. This amount will be deducted from the
        total cost of the activity to calculate the total computable Medicaid
        cost for this activity.
      helpText: >-
        **Example:** For a $1,000,000 project that is 80% cost allocated to
        Medicaid (related to 80% Medicaid transaction volume, for example) and
        20% for all other stakeholders, enter $200,000 (20% of $1,000,000). 

        **Example:** For a $1,000,000 project which receives a $100,000 grant
        (i.e. other funding) prior to cost allocation and is cost allocated to
        Medicaid at 80%, enter $280,000 ($100,000 [other funding] + $180,000
        [20% of the remaining $900,000]).
