      in terms of Outcomes and Metrics.


      An **Outcome** is a distinct and measurable improvement to Medicaid
      program management, monitoring, or administration, resulting from the
      delivery of IT system functionality. Outcomes should support the
      priorities of the Medicaid program and be directly enabled by the state’s
      IT project.


      A **Metric** is a measure that would demonstrate whether a system is
      meeting an outcome. Metrics support both  CMS-required and state-proposed
      outcomes, and are comprised of underlying data. In accordance with 42 CFR
      §433.112.
