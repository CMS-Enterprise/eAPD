    An **Outcome** is a discrete and measurable improvement to Medicaid program management, monitoring, or administration, 
    resulting from the delivery of IT system functionality. Outcomes should support the priorities of the Medicaid program 
    and be directly enabled by the state’s IT project.


    A **Metric** is a measure that would demonstrate whether a system is meeting an outcome. Metrics support both 
    CMS-required and state-proposed outcomes, and are comprised of underlying data. In accordance with 42 CFR §433.112.
