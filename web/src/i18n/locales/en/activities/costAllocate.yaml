    Cost allocation plan must include all participants
    and their associated costs to depict non-Medicaid activities.


    [ol]
    CMS will work with states individually to determine the
    most appropriate cost allocation methodology.

    HITECH cost allocation formulas should be based on direct benefit to
    Medicaid EHR incentive program, accounting for state
    projections of eligible Medicaid provider participation.

    Cost allocation must account for other available federal funding
    sources including division of resources and activities across relevant
    payers, and relative benefit to the state Medicaid program.

    Ensure cost allocations are current. Cost allocations should be current and
    ensure financial participation of all parties so Medicaid funds are neither
    the sole contributor at the onset, nor the primary source of funding. Other
    payers who may benefit must contribute their share from the outset. The
    absence of ancillary payers is not sufficient cause for Medicaid to be the
    primary payer.

      Do not assume absence of other payers is sufficient cause for
      Medicaid to be primary payer. Limit ambiguity about other
      potential federal funding sources.

      Other funding consists of funds that are not directly tied to the CMS
      grant and the matching state funds for this activity. This funding may
      come from another federal source, another state agency, and/or
      contributions or donations from a third party. Other funding will be
      deducted from the total cost of the activity prior to calculating the
      Medicaid share.

      to this activity. Calculations for the Federal and State share will be updated

  quarterlyFFPInstruction:
    heading: Estimated Quarterly Expenditure
    detail: >-
      For each quarter, enter the percentage of the total Medicaid FFP cost that
      will be spent in each category. The auto-calculated dollar values for each
      quarter should align with the state's quarterly FFP estimates for CMS. As
      a reminder, In-house costs equals state staff + other state expenses.
    helpText: >-
      Input a higher percentage in quarters where there may be non-reoccurring
      costs and adjust the other quarters downward to ensure the totals do not
      exceed 100%. Examples of non-reoccurring costs may include a one-time
      state equipment purchases (in-house costs) or payments on a contract
      deliverable (private contractor costs). An example of a reoccurring cost
      may include a salaried positions where the cost is equally divided into
      each quarter.
