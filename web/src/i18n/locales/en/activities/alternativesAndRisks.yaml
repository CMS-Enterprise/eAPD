    that was ultimately selected.

costBenefitAnalysis:
  heading: Cost Benefit Analysis
  detail: >-
    Provide the results of the state's cost benefit analysis associated with
    this activity. Explain how the results of this analysis informed how the

    needed, explain why it was not applicable to this activity.

feasibilityStudy:
  heading: Feasibility Study
  detail: >-
    Provide the results of the state's feasibility study. If no feasibility
    study was conducted, explain why not and whether or not the feasibility
    study was waived by law or not required in regulation. Note: CMS regulations

forseeableRisks:
  heading: Forseeable Risks
  detail: >-
    Describe any forseeable risks associated with your proposed solution,
    including the strategy for mitigation of the identified risk(s).
  helpText: >-
    **Example:** A potential risk to the proposed solution is system outage and
    downtime. The state has determined the risk can be minimized when proper
    precautions are in place and a plan for communications for outages has been
    established. The state accepts this risk and will oversee the mitigation
    efforts through monitoring and oversight of contract service level
    agreements.
