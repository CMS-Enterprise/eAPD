  title: Key Personnel and Program Management Planning
  instruction:
    short: >-
      Identify key state staff who will be involved in all activities listed in
      this APD.
    detail: >-
      Personnel listed in this section must be assigned to APD by name, role,
      time commitment, and cost, where applicable.
    helpText: >-
      Key personnel are individuals involved with all activities within this
      APD, or are directly involved with governance, coordination, stakeholder
      decision-making, oversight, and/or performance of the activities as they affect
      the stateâ€™s Medicaid program. Individuals whose responsibilities
      apply only to specific activities should be listed individually under Program
      Activities instead. CMS seeks to ensure  state teams are adequately resourced,
      but does not require states to provide key vendor personnel to satisfy this
      requirement.
