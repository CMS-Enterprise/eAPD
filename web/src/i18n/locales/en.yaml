    costAllocate: 
      title: Cost Allocation
      helpText: >-
        As specified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87, a
        cost allocation plan must be included that identifies all participants
        and their associated cost allocation to depict non-Medicaid activities
        and non-Medicaid FTEs participating in this project (if any):   


        1. CMS will work with states on an individual basis to determine the
        most appropriate cost allocation methodology.   
        
        2. HITECH cost allocation formulas should be based on direct benefit
        to the Medicaid EHR incentive program, taking into account state
        projections of eligible Medicaid provider participation in the
        incentive program.  
        
        3. Cost allocation must account for other available federal funding
        sources, division of resources and activities across relevant payers,
        and relative benefit to the state Medicaid program, among other
        factors.  
      
        4. Cost allocations should be current and ensure financial
        participation of all parties so Medicaid funds are neither the
        sole contributor at the onset, nor primary source of funding. Other
        payers who may benefit must contribute their share from the outset.
        The absence of ancillary payers is not sufficient cause for
        Medicaid to be primary payer.
      methodology: 
        title: Cost allocation methodology description
        reminder: >-
          Do not assume absence of other payers is sufficient cause for
          Medicaid to be primary payer. Limit ambiguity about other
          potential federal funding sources. For example, if no CHIP
          funds are being requested, include a statement in this section.

        Describe how this activity will support the Medicaid standards
        and conditions.
      modularity: 
        header: Modularity
        subheader: >-
          This condition requires the use of a modular, flexible approach
          to systems development, including the use of open interfaces
          and exposed application programming interfaces (API); the
          separation of business rules from core programming; and the
          availability of business rules in both human and machine-readable
          formats.  


          The commitment to formal system development methodology
          and open, reusable system architecture is extremely important in
          order to ensure that states can more easily change and maintain
          systems, as well as integrate and interoperate with a clinical and
          administrative ecosystem designed to deliver person-centric services
          and benefits. Modularity is breaking down systems requirements into
          component parts. Extremely complex systems can be developed as
          part of a service-oriented architecture (SOA).  


          Modularity also helps address the challenges of customization. 
          Baseline web services and capabilities can be developed for and used by anyone, with
          exceptions for specific business processes handled by a separate
          module that interoperates with the baseline modules.    

        
          With Modularity, changes can be made independently to the baseline
          capabilities without affecting how the extension works. By doing
          so, the design ensures that future iterations of software can be
          deployed without breaking custom functionality. A critical element
          of compliance with this condition is providing CMS with an
          understanding of where services and code will be tightly coupled,
          and where the state will pursue a more aggressive decoupling strategy.

      mita:

          This condition requires states to align to and advance increasingly
          in MITA maturity for business, architecture, and data. CMS expects
          the states to complete and continue to make measurable progress
          in implementing their MITA roadmaps.  


          Already the MITA investments
          by federal, state, and private partners have allowed us to make
          important incremental improvements to share data and reuse business
          models, applications, and components. CMS strives, however, to
          build on and accelerate the modernization of the Medicaid enterprise
          that has thus far been achieved.  
        title: Describe how this activity will support the MITA condition
      industryStandards: 
        header: Industry Standards
        subheader: >-
          States must ensure alignment with, and incorporation of, industry
          standards: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
          Act of 1996 (HIPAA) security, privacy and transaction standards;
          accessibility standards established under section 508 of the
          Rehabilitation Act, or standards that provide greater accessibility
          for individuals with disabilities, and compliance with federal
          civil rights laws; standards adopted by the Secretary under section
          1104 of the Affordable Care Act; and standards and protocols
          adopted by the Secretary under section 1561 of the Affordable
          Care Act.  


          CMS must ensure that Medicaid infrastructure and
          information system investments are made with the assurance that
          timely and reliable adoption of industry standards and productive
          use of those standards are part of the investments. Industry
          standards promote reuse, data exchange, and reduction of
          administrative burden on patients, providers, and applicants.

      leverage: 
        header: Leverage
        subheader: >-
          State solutions should promote sharing, leverage, and reuse of
          Medicaid technologies and systems within and among states. States
          can benefit substantially from the experience and investments
          of other states through the reuse of components and technologies
          already developed, consistent with a service-oriented architecture,
          from publicly available or commercially sold components and
          products, and from the use of cloud technologies to share
          infrastructure and applications.  


          CMS commits to work assertively with the states to identify promising state systems 
          that can be leveraged and used by other states. Further, CMS would strongly
          encourage the states to move to regional or multistate solutions
          when cost effective, and will seek to support and facilitate such
          solutions. In addition, CMS will expedite APD approvals for states
          that are participating in shared development activities with other
          states, and those developing components and solutions expressly
          intended for successful reuse by other states.  


          CMS will also review carefully any proposed investments in sub-state systems 
          when the federal government is asked to share in the costs of updating or
          maintaining multiple systems performing essentially the same
          functions within the same state.

          Systems should support accurate and timely processing of claims
          (including claims of eligibility), adjudications, and effective
          communications with providers, beneficiaries, and the public.  


          Ultimately, the test of an effective and efficient system is whether
          it supports and enables an effective and efficient business
          process, producing and communicating the intended operational
          results with a high degree of reliability and accuracy. It would be

          Solutions should produce transaction data, reports, and performance
          information that would contribute to program evaluation, continuous
          improvement in business operations, and transparency and
          accountability. Systems should be able to produce and to expose
          electronically the accurate data that are necessary for oversight,
          administration, evaluation, integrity, and transparency.  
          
          These reports should be automatically generated through open interfaces
          to designated federal repositories or data hubs, with appropriate
          audit trails. MITA 3.0 will provide additional detail about
          reporting requirements and needs that arise from the Affordable
          Care Act. Additional details about data definitions, specifications,
          timing, and routing of information will be supplied later this year.

      interoperability: 
        header: Interoperability
        subheader: >-
          Systems must ensure seamless coordination and integration with the
          Exchange (whether run by the state or federal government), and
          allow interoperability with health information exchanges, public
          health agencies, human services programs, and community
          organizations providing outreach and enrollment assistance
          services. CMS expects that a key outcome of the government’s
          technology investments will be a much higher degree of interaction
          and interoperability in order to maximize value and minimize
          burden and costs on providers, beneficiaries, and other
          stakeholders.  


          CMS is emphasizing in this standard and condition
          an expectation that Medicaid agencies work in concert with
          exchanges (whether state or federally administered) to share
          business services and technology investments in order to produce
          seamless and efficient customer experiences.  

          
          Systems must also be
          built with the appropriate architecture and using standardized
          messaging and communication protocols in order to preserve the
          ability to efficiently, effectively, and appropriately exchange
          data with other participants in the health and human services
          enterprise. As stated in MITA Framework 2.0, each state is
          “responsible for knowing and understanding its environment
          (data, applications and infrastructure) in order to map its data
          to information sharing requirements.  

          
          The data-sharing architecture also addresses the conceptual and 
          logical mechanisms used for data sharing (i.e., data hubs, repositories, and registries). 
          The data-sharing architecture will also address data semantics,
          data harmonization strategies, shared-data ownership, security
          and privacy implications of shared data, and the quality of
          shared data.

      mitigationStrategy: 
        header: Mitigation Strategy
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(18) requires that states
          submit mitigation plans addressing strategies to reduce the
          consequences of failure for all major milestones and functionality.
          Maintaining a mitigation plan is an industry standard best practice
          for any major IT build; CMS expects that states will identify
          potential risks and develop strategies to address those risks
          throughout the system lifecycle.  


          Mitigation plans for major
          Medicaid E&E system or MMIS projects should address minimum
          expected functionality, critical success factors, and risk factors
          as tied to major milestones identified in the APD.  


          The mitigation plans should also reflect key events and dates that would trigger
          the mitigation, and projected timeframe for the mitigation sunset.
          States should consider strategies to address risks for the M&O phase
          of the project, such as staffing issues and software upgrades. CMS
          expects states to revise and resubmit their plans to CMS as risks
          and mitigations change along the system life cycle. States’ proposed
          mitigations should be commensurate with the nature and scope of the
          identified risks.  
        


          We also expect that states will submit their
          mitigation plans with the APDs to demonstrate compliance with
          this condition.

      keyPersonnel: 
        header: Key Personnel
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(19) requires that states
          identify their key state personnel assigned to each major project
          by name, role, and time commitment. Before we approve a state to
          launch a major IT initiative, CMS wants to ensure that the state
          team is adequately resourced. States do not need to provide key
          vendor personnel for this requirement.  
          


          As stated in the
          provision, this information must be included in the APD. 
          For changes to key personnel that occur after an APD is approved, states should
          notify their CMS points of contact in writing (including by email)
          and formally reflect the change in the next planned APD update.  


          This condition refines and strengthens the existing APD
          requirements regarding personnel resource statements as required
          under 45 CFR 95.610. For Medicaid E&E APDs, states should include
          this information in the “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment (EE)
          Implementation Advance Planning Document (IAPD) Template” (OMB
          Approval Number: 0938-1268). Although there is currently no APD
          template for MMIS APDs, states must include this information in
          all MMIS APDs for major IT initiatives.

      documentation: 
        header: Documentation
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(20) requires that states
          maintain documentation for certain software such that the software
          could be operated by contractors and other users. This condition is
          limited to software that is developed using federal funds; it does
          not apply to Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software,
          software-as-a-service, or business-solutions-as-a-service.  


          Adequate documentation means that other users could operate the software
          with reasonable alterations for a specific hardware or operating
          system. CMS is neutral as to the specific hardware or operating
          system that the software uses. Documentation must follow industry
          standards and best practices, and must include components,
          procedures, layouts, interfaces, inputs, outputs, and other
          necessary information so that the systems could be installed and
          operated by a variety of contractors or other users.  


          While the APD should address how the state plans to maintain documentation, such
          documentation is not required to be submitted along with the APD.
          It is the state’s responsibility to make the documentation
          available upon request and to upload documentation to CALT or
          successor systems as needed for gate reviews or for reuse.
          Submission to other repositories may be required as CMS explores
          other options.

          Strategies to Minimize Cost and Difficulty on Alternative
          Hardware or Operating System
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(21) requires that states
          consider strategies to minimize the costs and difficulty of
          operating the software on alternate hardware or operating
          systems. This condition recognizes the significant federal and
          state investments that are involved with major Medicaid IT projects
          and requires that states consider options beyond software that
          will reduce costs or promote reuse.    


          States should describe in the APD the strategies that were considered when 
          deciding which solution was the most economical and efficient. States are not required to
          adopt a particular strategy, but CMS must have sufficient
          description to evaluate the extent to which the state looked at
          other solutions. States should consider, at a minimum, the options
          that offer more opportunities for reuse, lower development costs,
          lower long-term operating costs, and shorter development time as
          well as the extent to which the solutions can be readily implemented
          with alternate hardware and operating systems.  


          States should consider this new condition in conjunction with existing APD
          requirements regarding cost benefit analyses required at 45 CFR
          95.605 or § 95.610.
