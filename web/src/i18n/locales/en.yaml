        this APD, if you don't have any HIE activities you can skip this
        section. This section should include a brief description for each
        item below:


        (1) Description of your state's HIE approach (statewide, sub-state
        health information office (HIOs), etc.);

        CMS recommends states reach out to their regional CMS HITECH
        contacts prior to developing an HIE funding request. HIE funding
        requests are complex, and early consultation with CMS facilitates a
        more efficient approval process.

      modularity: 
        header: "Modularity"
        subheader: "This condition requires the use of a modular, flexible approach to systems development, including the use of open interfaces and exposed application programming interfaces (API); the separation of business rules from core programming; and the availability of business rules in both human and machine-readable formats. The commitment to formal system development methodology and open, reusable system architecture is extremely important in order to ensure that states can more easily change and maintain systems, as well as integrate and interoperate with a clinical and administrative ecosystem designed to deliver person-centric services and benefits. Modularity is breaking down systems requirements into component parts. Extremely complex systems can be developed as part of a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Modularity also helps address the challenges of customization. Baseline web services and capabilities can be developed for and used by anyone, with exceptions for specific business processes handled by a separate module that interoperates with the baseline modules. With modularity, changes can be made independently to the baseline capabilities without affecting how the extension works. By doing so, the design ensures that future iterations of software can be deployed without breaking custom functionality. A critical element of compliance with this condition is providing CMS with an understanding of where services and code will be tightly coupled, and where the state will pursue a more aggressive decoupling strategy."

CMS expects the states to complete and continue to make measurable progress in implementing their MITA roadmaps. Already the MITA investments by federal, state, and private partners have allowed us to make important incremental improvements to share data and reuse business models, applications, and components. CMS strives, however, to build on and accelerate the modernization of the Medicaid enterprise that has thus far been achieved."

CMS must ensure that Medicaid infrastructure and information system investments are made with the assurance that timely and reliable adoption of industry standards and productive use of those standards are part of the investments. Industry standards promote reuse, data exchange, and reduction of administrative burden on patients, providers, and applicants."

      leverage: 
        header: "Leverage"
        subheader: "State solutions should promote sharing, leverage, and reuse of Medicaid technologies and systems within and among states. States can benefit substantially from the experience and investments of other states through the reuse of components and technologies already developed, consistent with a service-oriented architecture, from publicly available or commercially sold components and products, and from the use of cloud technologies to share infrastructure and applications. CMS commits to work assertively with the states to identify promising state systems that can be leveraged and used by other states. Further, CMS would strongly encourage the states to move to regional or multistate solutions when cost effective, and will seek to support and facilitate such solutions. In addition, CMS will expedite APD approvals for states that are participating in shared development activities with other states, and that are developing components and solutions expressly intended for successful reuse by other states. CMS will also review carefully any proposed investments in sub-state systems when the federal government is asked to share in the costs of updating or maintaining multiple systems performing essentially the same functions within the same state."

These reports should be automatically generated through open interfaces to designated federal repositories or data hubs, with appropriate audit trails. MITA 3.0 will provide additional detail about reporting requirements and needs that arise from the Affordable Care Act. Additional details about data definitions, specifications, timing, and routing of information will be supplied later this year."

      interoperability: 
        header: "Interoperability"
        subheader: "Systems must ensure seamless coordination and integration with the Exchange (whether run by the state or federal government), and allow interoperability with health information exchanges, public health agencies, human services programs, and community organizations providing outreach and enrollment assistance services. CMS expects that a key outcome of the government’s technology investments will be a much higher degree of interaction and interoperability in order to maximize value and minimize burden and costs on providers, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. CMS is emphasizing in this standard and condition an expectation that Medicaid agencies work in concert with Exchanges (whether state or federally administered) to share business services and technology investments in order to produce seamless and efficient customer experiences. Systems must also be built with the appropriate architecture and using standardized messaging and communication protocols in order to preserve the ability to efficiently, effectively, and appropriately exchange data with other participants in the health and human services enterprise. As stated in MITA Framework 2.0, each state is “responsible for knowing and understanding its environment (data, applications and infrastructure) in order to map its data to information sharing requirements. The data-sharing architecture also addresses the conceptual and logical mechanisms used for data sharing (i.e., data hubs, repositories, and registries). The data-sharing architecture will also address data semantics, data harmonization strategies, shared-data ownership, security and privacy implications of shared data, and the quality of shared data."

      mitigation: 
        header: "Mitigation Strategy"
        subheader: "The condition described at § 433.112(b)(18) requires that states submit mitigation plans addressing strategies to reduce the consequences of failure for all major milestones and functionality. Maintaining a mitigation plan is an industry standard best practice for any major IT build; CMS expects that states will identify potential risks and develop strategies to address those risks throughout the system lifecycle. Mitigation plans for major Medicaid E&E system or MMIS projects should address minimum expected functionality, critical success factors, and risk factors as tied to major milestones identified in the APD. The mitigation plans should also reflect key events and dates that would trigger the mitigation, and projected timeframe for the mitigation sunset. States should consider strategies to address risks for the M&O phase of the project, such as staffing issues and software upgrades. CMS expects states to revise and resubmit their plans to CMS as risks and mitigations change along the system life cycle. States’ proposed mitigations should be commensurate with the nature and scope of the identified risks. We also expect that states will submit their mitigation plans with the APDs to demonstrate compliance with this condition."

      keyPersonnel: 
        header: "Key Personnel"
        subheader: "The condition described at § 433.112(b)(19) requires that states identify their key state personnel assigned to each major project by name, role, and time commitment. Before we approve a state to launch a major IT initiative, CMS wants to ensure that the state team is adequately resourced. States do not need to provide key vendor personnel for this requirement. As stated in the provision, this information must be included in the APD. For changes to key personnel that occur after an APD is approved, states should notify their CMS points of contact in writing (including by email) and formally reflect the change in the next planned APD update. This condition refines and strengthens the existing APD requirements regarding personnel resource statements as required under 45 CFR 95.610. For Medicaid E&E APDs, states should include this information in the “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment (EE) Implementation Advance Planning Document (IAPD) Template” (OMB Approval Number: 0938-1268). Although there is currently no APD template for MMIS APDs, states must include this information in all MMIS APDs for major IT initiatives."

      documentation: 
        header: "Documentation"
        subheader: "The condition described at § 433.112(b)(20) requires that states maintain documentation for certain software such that the software could be operated by contractors and other users. This condition is limited to software that is developed using federal funds; it does not apply to Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software, software-as-a-service, or business-solutions-as-a-service. Adequate documentation means that other users could operate the software with reasonable alterations for a specific hardware or operating system. CMS is neutral as to the specific hardware or operating system that the software uses. Documentation must follow industry standards and best practices, and must include components, procedures, layouts, interfaces, inputs, outputs, and other necessary information so that the systems could be installed and operated by a variety of contractors or other users. While the APD should address how the state plans to maintain documentation, such documentation is not required to be submitted along with the APD. It is the state’s responsibility to make the documentation available upon request and to upload documentation to CALT or successor systems as needed for gate reviews or for reuse. Submission to other repositories may be required as CMS explores other options."

This condition recognizes the significant federal and state investments that are involved with major Medicaid IT projects and requires that states consider options beyond software that will reduce costs or promote reuse. States should describe in the APD the strategies that were considered when deciding which solution was the most economical and efficient. States are not required to adopt a particular strategy, but CMS must have sufficient description to evaluate the extent to which the state looked at other solutions. States should consider, at a minimum, the options that offer more opportunities for reuse, lower development costs, lower long-term operating costs, and shorter development time as well as the extent to which the solutions can be readily implemented with alternate hardware and operating systems. States should consider this new condition in conjunction with existing APD requirements regarding cost benefit analyses required at 45 CFR 95.605 or § 95.610."
