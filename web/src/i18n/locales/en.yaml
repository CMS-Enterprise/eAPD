        A cost allocation plan must include all participants

        and non-Medicaid FTEs participating in this project (if any):   

        1. CMS will work with states individually to determine the
        most appropriate cost allocation methodology.   
        
        2. HITECH cost allocation formulas should be based on direct benefit to
        Medicaid EHR incentive program, accounting for state
        projections of eligible Medicaid provider participation.
        
        3. Cost allocation must account for other available federal funding
        sources including division of resources and activities across relevant
        payers, and relative benefit to the state Medicaid program.
      
        4. Ensure cost allocations are current. Medicaid funds should be not be
        sole contributor to Cost allocations should be current and ensure financial
        participation of all parties so Medicaid funds are neither the
        sole contributor at the onset, nor primary source of funding. Other
        payers who may benefit must contribute their share from the outset.
        The absence of ancillary payers is not sufficient cause for
        Medicaid to be primary payer.
      methodology: 
        title: Cost allocation methodology description
        reminder: >-
          Do not assume absence of other payers is sufficient cause for
          Medicaid to be primary payer. Limit ambiguity about other

      modularity: 
        header: Modularity
        subheader: >-
          Modularity requires the use of a modular, flexible approach
          to systems development, including the use of open interfaces
          and exposed application programming interfaces (API); the
          separation of business rules from core programming; and the
          availability of business rules in both human and machine-readable
          formats.  


          Commitment to formal system development methodology
          and open reusable system architecture is extremely important in
          order to ensure that states can more easily change and maintain
          systems. Integration and interoperability with a clinical and
          administrative ecosystem, is designed to deliver person-centric services
          and benefits. Modularity is breaking down systems requirements into
          component parts. Extremely complex systems can be developed as
          part of a service-oriented architecture (SOA).  


          Modularity also helps address the challenges of customization. 
          Baseline web services and capabilities can be developed for and used
          by anyone, with exceptions for specific business processes handled
          by a separate module that interoperates with the baseline modules.    

        
          Changes can be made independently to baseline
          capabilities without affecting how the extension works. By doing
          so, the design ensures that future iterations of software can be
          deployed without breaking custom functionality. A critical element
          of compliance with this condition is providing CMS with an
          understanding where services and code will be integrated, and where
          the state will pursue a more aggressive decoupling strategy.

        subheader: >-
          State solutions should promote sharing among, leverage, and reuse of
          Medicaid technologies and systems among states. States
          can benefit substantially from the experience and investments
          of other states through the reuse of components and technologies
          already developed, consistent with a service-oriented architecture,
          from publicly available or commercially sold components and
          products, and from the use of cloud technologies to share
          infrastructure and applications.  


          CMS commits to work assertively with the states to identify promising
          state systems  that can be leveraged by other states. CMS strongly
          encourages states to move to regional or multi-state solutions
          when cost effective. In addition, CMS will expedite APD approvals for states
          that are participating in shared development activities (including
          developing components intended for successful reuse) with other states.


          CMS will also review carefully any proposed investments in sub-state systems 
          when the federal government is asked to share costs of updating or
          maintaining multiple systems performing redundant functions within the same state.

          improvement in business operations, transparency, and accountability.
          
          Reports should be automatically generated through open interfaces
          to designated federal repositories or data hubs, with appropriate
          audit trails. MITA 3.0 will provide additional detail about
          reporting requirements arising from the Affordable
          Care Act. Additional details about data definitions, specifications,

      interoperability: 
        header: Interoperability
        subheader: >-
          Systems must ensure seamless coordination and integration with the
          state or federal exchanges, and
          allow interoperability with HIE, public
          health agencies, human services programs, and community
          organizations providing outreach and enrollment assistance
          services. CMS expects a key outcome government
          technology investments will be improved interaction
          and interoperability to maximize value and minimize costs
          on providers, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders.  


          CMS expects Medicaid agencies to work in concert with
          exchanges (whether state or federally administered) to share
          business services and technology investments to produce
          seamless and efficient customer experiences.  

          
          Systems must include appropriate architecture, and standardized
          communication protocols to preserve the
          ability to appropriately exchange
          data with other participants in the health and human services
          enterprise. According to MITA Framework 2.0, each state is
          “responsible for knowing and understanding its environment
          (data, applications and infrastructure) in order to map its data

          The data-sharing architecture addresses conceptual and 
          logical mechanisms used (i.e., data hubs, repositories, and registries). 
          It also addresses data semantics, data harmonization strategies, 
          shared-data ownership, security and privacy implications and
          quality of shared data.

          Condition § 433.112(b)(18) requires states
          submit mitigation plans addressing strategies to reduce the
          consequences of failure for all major milestones and functionality.
          Maintaining a mitigation plan is an industry standard best practice
          for any major IT build; CMS expects that states will identify
          potential risks and develop strategies to address those risks
          throughout the system lifecycle.  


          Mitigation plans for major
          Medicaid E&E system or MMIS projects should address minimum
          expected functionality, critical success factors, and risk factors
          tied to major milestones identified in the APD.  


          Mitigation plans should also reflect key events and dates that would trigger
          mitigation, and projected timeframe for sunset.
          States should consider strategies to address risks for the M&O project
          phase, such as staffing issues and software upgrades. CMS expects states
          to revise and resubmit their plans to CMS as risks and mitigations
          change along the system lifecycle. States’ proposed mitigations should
          be commensurate with nature and scope of identified risks.  
          
          CMS also expects states will submit mitigation plans with the APDs to
          demonstrate compliance with this condition.

      keyPersonnel: 
        header: Key Personnel
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(19) requires that states
          identify their key state personnel assigned to each major project
          by name, role, and time commitment. Before we approve a state to
          launch a major IT initiative, CMS wants to ensure that the state
          team is adequately resourced. States do not need to provide key
          vendor personnel for this requirement.


          As stated in the
          provision, this information must be included in the APD. 
          For changes to key personnel that occur after an APD is approved,
          states should notify their CMS points of contact in writing
          (including by email) and formally reflect the change in the next
          planned APD update.  


          This condition refines and strengthens the existing APD
          requirements regarding personnel resource statements as required
          under 45 CFR 95.610. For Medicaid E&E APDs, states should include
          this information in the “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment (EE)
          Implementation Advance Planning Document (IAPD) Template” (OMB
          Approval Number: 0938-1268). Although there is currently no APD
          template for MMIS APDs, states must include this information in
          all MMIS APDs for major IT initiatives.

      documentation: 
        header: Documentation
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(20) requires that states
          maintain documentation for certain software such that the software
          could be operated by contractors and other users. This condition is
          limited to software that is developed using federal funds; it does
          not apply to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software,
          software-as-a-service, or business-solutions-as-a-service.  


          Adequate documentation means other users could operate software
          with reasonable alterations for specific hardware or operating
          system. CMS is neutral with regrard to hardware or operating
          system. Documentation must follow industry
          standards and include components,
          procedures, layouts, interfaces, inputs, outputs, and other
          necessary information to ensure systems could be installed and
          operated by a variety of contractors or other users.  


          While the APD should address how the state plans to maintain documentation,
          documentation is not required with the APD.
          States are responsible for making documentation
          available upon request and to upload documentation to CALT or
          successor systems as needed for gate reviews or reuse.
          Submission to other repositories may be required as CMS explores
          other options.

          Strategies to Minimize Cost and Difficulty on Alternative
          Hardware or Operating System
        subheader: >-
          The condition described at § 433.112(b)(21) requires that states
          consider strategies to minimize the costs and difficulty of
          operating the software on alternate hardware or operating
          systems. This condition recognizes the significant federal and
          state investments that are involved with major Medicaid IT projects
          and requires that states consider options beyond software that
          will reduce costs or promote reuse.    

          States should describe strategies considered when 
          deciding which most efficient solution. States are not required to
          adopt a particular strategy, but CMS must have sufficient
          description to evaluate extent the state conisdered
          other solutions. States should consider, at a minimum, the options
          that offer more opportunities for reuse, lower development costs,
          lower long-term operating costs, and shorter development time as
          well as the extent to which the solutions can be readily implemented
          with alternate hardware and operating systems.  


          States should consider this new condition in conjunction with existing APD
          requirements regarding cost benefit analyses required at 45 CFR
          95.605 or § 95.610.
