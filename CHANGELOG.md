# v1.1.0

Released: September 27, 2019

#### üöÄ New features

- Attempt to alert users before automatically logging them out due to inactivity. The app will try to use built-in browser notifications as well as flashing the tab title. In browsers that support it, the app treats activity in any eAPD tab as valid, so all eAPD tabs will remain valid as long as at least one of them is getting activity. ([#1697])

- Add spellcheck to rich text fields ([#1769])

- For users in American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, or U.S. Virgin Islands, do not attempt to display a territory outline at the top of the sidebar because we don't have those outlines ([#1423]; see [#1730] for more information)
