# Next release

Anticipated release: TBD

#### üöÄ New features

- Attempt to alert users before automatically logging them out due to inactivity. The app will try to use built-in browser notifications as well as flashing the tab title. In browsers that support it, the app treats activity in any eAPD tab as valid, so all eAPD tabs will remain valid as long as at least one of them is getting activity. ([#1697])
- Automatically select numeric form field contents when the field is focused if the current value is 0 ([#1736])

#### üêõ Bugs fixed

- Fixed semantic heading levels ([#1695])
- Fixed a keyboard focus order problem when adding new items to a list ([#1712])
- Fixed a keyboard focus order problem with the system use banner ([#1715])

- For users in American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, or U.S. Virgin Islands, do not attempt to display a territory outline at the top of the sidebar because we don't have those outlines ([#1423]; see [#1730] for more information)
- Fixed a bug where adding a new contractor resource didn't expand the contractor form ([#1710])
- Make the navigation sidebar scrollable. ([#1475])
- Fixed the width on activity overview detail and statement of alternatives textbox labels ([#1640])
- Made the "manage account" and "login" text the same size in the header dropdown ([#1655], [#1680])

- Adds margin to the bottom of the state dashboard ([#1601])
