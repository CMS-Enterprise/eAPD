# Next release

Anticipated release: TBD

#### üöÄ New features

- Attempt to alert users before automatically logging them out due to inactivity. The app will try to use built-in browser notifications as well as flashing the tab title.

#### üêõ Bugs fixed

- Prompt for confirmation before deleting APD key personnel ([#1651], [#1647])
- Fixed accessibility issues on the login page and the dashboard ([#1688])
- Fixed semantic heading levels ([#1695])
- Fixed a keyboard focus order problem when adding new items to a list ([#1712])
- Fixed a keyboard focus order problem with the system use banner ([#1715])
- Removed the emoji button from the rich text editor ([#1649])
