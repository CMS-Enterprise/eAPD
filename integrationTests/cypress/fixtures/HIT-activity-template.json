    "detailedDescription": "Tycho Medicaid is seeking funding to design, develop, and implement modifications to the existing State Level Repository (SLR) for continued administration of the EHR Incentive Program. The modifications of the SLR for CMS program rule changes and guidance changes (Stage 3, IPPS, and OPPS) will require extensive development and implementation efforts and is essential to the effective administration of the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. Modifications to the SLR are done in phases depending on how CMS rule changes occur. The implementation of the design elements will require provider onboarding activities to be initiated and completed including outreach and training for all program participants. The SLR will increase the efficiency with which Tycho Medicaid administers the program; allow for increased oversight and assure that the program is operated in accordance with the complex and evolving program rules and requirements.",
