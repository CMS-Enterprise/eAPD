### Moving text on a page or large text change

If a screenshot or annotated screenshot would be helpful to show context of the
request within the app, or to show before and after please include it. This
might occur when there is a lot of text changed on one page, or text that is
moved into a different area on a page.

If a large amount of text is changed, or text is moved on a page the issue
should include at least a quick statement about any decisions or conversations
that led to this content being created or changed, a consideration of the
source/reference docs (APD templates), regulatory rules, etc. as needed
